- when doing "make srcpackage", create package/ subdir if it doesn't exist
  (the tarball will become a file named "package" then and copying the .changes
  file to package/ will fail) 

- make sure to recreate the .spec file upon "make srcpackage"
  (.spec.in might have changed since the last "cmake" call)

- make sure to use the latest VERSION file upon "make srcpackage"
