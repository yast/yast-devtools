Y2M - the YaST2 meta tool

This is a simple tool to help you to checkout all YaST modules, while
maintaining the directory structure of the former svn repo.

With this tool you can
 * checkout all or just your favorite modules
 * switch all (or favorite) modules to a specific branch
 * run git pull on all (or favorite) modules
with just one command.

Note: There is no need to use this tool.
      You can do everything manually as well.

Installation:

 cd $CHECKOUTDIR
 git clone git@github.com:yast/yast-meta meta
 cd meta
 ln -s `pwd`/y2m ~/bin/

Usage:
  y2m <command> [<modules>,..]

commands
    clone        : run git clone for <modules>
    up|pull      : run git pull for a <modules>
    co|br <name> : run git checkout to switch to branch <name> for <modules>
modules
    'ALL' : applies to all current known yast modules
    'FAV' : applies to only your favorite modules, set in ~/.y2m
    <lowercase string> : applies to the named modules

Reserved Branch and Tag Name Prefixes

In order to maintain a certain consistency between the modules there are
some prefixes that you should *not* use for your own branches/tags.
They are reserved for openSUSE or SLE releases.
Reserved prefixed for branches and tags:
 * 'openSUSE-'
 * 'SLE-'
 * 'Code-'
