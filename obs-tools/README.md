## OBS tools

Jenkins tools are intended to help with operations
on <http://build.opensuse.org/> ( or internal instance ).

They are not intended to be distributed in a RPM.
Usage requires obs permissions for yast projects.
If you can do your task quicker than reading the script
then it is not the right tool for you.

### opensuse42_submit.sh
